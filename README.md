# fresh-and-lean
lean code kata - fresco plc software aka checkout-kata

timed kata: requirements changes every 10minutes. 

I've seen it the first time @lscc @SoftwareCraftmanshipMeetup: it was really fun but I wanted to re-do it another time.

As you can see by the history, even if there were only six different iterations, 
I failed four times to complete the current iteration on time and had to restart with a new branch from the previous iteration.

Interesting kata, probably more enjoyable the very first time and if done in pairs against other pairs.

**Don't spoil you the fun, don't take a look at the rules until you are ready to start**
